== Widgets

=== GroupBox: New MenuBar Position TITLE

In addition to the existing menu-bar position TOP and BOTTOM, the GroupBox now supports TITLE. The menu-bar is placed in the header of the group-box right of the title-label DIV. Scout Classic: see property `menuBarPosition` in `AbstractGroupBox` and constant `IGroupBox.MENU_BAR_POSITION_TITLE`. Scout JS: see property `menuBarPosition` in `GroupBox.js` and constant `scout.GroupBox.MenuBarPosition.TITLE`.

=== TabBox: New Tab Style
The tab box has a new property `ITabBox.PROP_TAB_AREA_STYLE` with currently two possible tab styles.

* `ITabBox.TAB_AREA_STYLE_DEFAULT`: Default appearance
* `ITabBox.TAB_AREA_STYLE_SPREAD_EVEN`: This style will spread all the tabs over the available space. When using this style, all the menu will be pushed into the ellipse menu.

=== TileGrid Groups: Show Loading State per Group

Each Group in a TileGrid can now display a loading indicator in the group header individually. This is useful if each displayed
group loads data from an individual data source. Scout Classic: call `AbstractGroup#setLoading(boolean)`, Scout JS: call `Group.js#setLoading(boolean)`. Note: it is still possible to set the loading state on the TileGrid, to indicate the whole grid (and not an individual group) is loading data.

endif::[]

=== RadioButton and CheckBox: Wrap Text

Both widgets `RadioButton` and `CheckBox` (aka BooleanField), now support the `wrapText` property. This means a radio button or a check box can have a label with a long text on multiple lines. In order to see the wrapped text, the field must have a `gridH` > 1 or set the `gridUseUiHeight` property to true.

=== Button: Support for HTML and Binary Resources

The `Button` now supports the property `htmlEnabled` which allows to use HTML in the label part of the button. You can even reference binary resources in your HTML. Simply call the method `AbstractButton#setAttachments(Collection<? extends BinaryResource>)` and define a reference, say an image URL, in your label HTML:

[source,html]
----
<img src="binaryResource:business-card.jpg" />
----

=== ImageField: Support for File Upload

The `ImageField` has a new property `uploadEnabled`. When set to true, the field opens the native file chooser and performs a file upload.

=== Mode Selector: Implemented alternative display style

The mode selector now has a different appearance for the two field styles `IFormField.FIELD_STYLE_CLASSIC` and `IFormField.FIELD_STYLE_ALTERNATIVE`.

=== Enabled & InheritAccessibility

The `enabled` property already existing for FormFields, Actions and other Scout elements has been moved to the top level Widget class.
Therefore all widgets can now be disabled as it already was in Scout JS.
Additionally Scout Classic widgets also support dynamic enabled/disabled dimensions on all widgets now as it already existed for FormFields.

The `inheritAccessibility` property that already existed for Actions (e.g. Menus) can now be used on all widgets.
This is especially interesting for FormFields for which it was necessary to do that using multiple setEnabled() calls until now.

=== Consistent Parent

Lots of Scout widgets like `Actions`, `FormFields`, `Tiles` or `Tables` can have a parent element.
Until now there have been several methods to access parent elements (e.g. `IActionNode#getParent()`, `ITile#getContainer()`, `IFormField#getParentField`, etc.) and it was only available on the specific element (e.g. for a Table).
Now there is one `getParent()` method for all widgets. Furthermore visit methods have been added to traverse up the parent hierarchy.


== Data Objects
The Scout data object support was moved from the Scout platform to the module `org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject`.
The package imports of all data object related classes therefore changed:
From `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.dataobject` to `org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject`

=== Renamings
`org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.desktop.datachange.DoChangeEvent` -> `org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.desktop.datachange.ItemDataChangeEvent`

=== Dependencies
All modules which use data objects were extended with a dependency to `org.eclipse.scout.rt.dataobject`

* `org.eclipse.scout.rt.rest`
* `org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.api`
