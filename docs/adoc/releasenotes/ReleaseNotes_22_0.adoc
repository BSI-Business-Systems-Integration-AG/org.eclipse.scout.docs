== Native Notification Support

It's now possible to send notifications via the Notification API. The DesktopNotification has two new properties to control
the behavior: nativeOnly and nativeNotificationVisibility.

== Text Post-Processors

A new Bean `org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform.nls.ITextPostProcessor` has been introduced which allows to modify all texts returned by a TextProviderService.

This allows applying application wide logic on all translated texts including the ones provided by Scout itself.
