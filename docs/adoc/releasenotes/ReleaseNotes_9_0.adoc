== Dark Theme

Enter the dark side... and use the new dark theme of Scout!

[[img-dark-theme]]
.Dark Theme

Scout now provides a dark theme in addition to the default theme. You can either activate it by default by setting the property `scout.ui.theme` to `dark` in the `config.properties`, or let the user choose what he likes more.


== Disabling Close- & Cancel-Buttons

Until Scout 8.0 a Close- or Cancel-Button ignored the enabled-granted property to ensure the form can be closed even if the full form has been disabled using `setEnabledGranted(false)`. This was confusing because the same convenience was not available for all other enabled dimensions.

Since Scout 9.0 Close- and Cancel-Buttons can be disabled like any other form field. But one special handling is still present: The method `isEnabledIncludingParents` ignores the enabled state of the parents and always returns the state of the button only.

So if a Form or GroupBox is disabled using `setEnabled(false)` or `setEnabledGranted(false)` or any other dimension, the full form gets disabled except the Close- and Cancel-Buttons. As soon as the button is disabled explicitly (e.g. by calling `setEnabled(false)` on the button itself or by propagating to the button using `setEnabled(false, false, true)` on a parent composite) it will be disabled and the form cannot be closed anymore.


== Improved Scrollbar Usability

The layout structure of the scrollbar comes now with an additional div, and the positioning of the scollbar uses now padding instead of margin.

With this change, the usability of the scout scrollbar has improved. The thumb is now easier to catch, especially when positioned at the very edge of the screen.
