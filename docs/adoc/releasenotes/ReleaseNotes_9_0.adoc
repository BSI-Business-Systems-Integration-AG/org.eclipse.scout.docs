* The initial version of Eclipse Scout 8.0 was part of the Eclipse _Photon_ release (June 27, 2018).
* An updated version was released as part of the _2018-09_ release (September 19, 2018).

=== Service Releases

Even though with Eclipse Photon there will no longer be regular Eclipse _service releases_ (see https://wiki.eclipse.org/SimRel/Simultaneous_Release_Cycle_FAQ#What_is_the_Simultaneous_Release_cycle_.3F[the Simultaneous Release Cycle FAQ] for details), Scout 8.0 will continue to be maintained and a new build released from time to time.

== Dark Theme

Enter the dark side... and use the new dark theme of Scout!

.Dark Theme

Scout now provides a dark theme in addition to the default theme. You can either activate it by default by setting the property `scout.ui.theme` to `dark` in the `config.properties`, or let the user choose what he likes more.


== Disabling Close- & Cancel-Buttons

Until Scout 8.0 a Close- or Cancel-Button ignored the enabled-granted property to ensure the form can be closed even if the full form has been disabled using `setEnabledGranted(false)`. This was confusing because the same convenience was not available for all other enabled dimensions.

Since Scout 9.0 Close- and Cancel-Buttons can be disabled like any other form field. But one special handling is still present: The method `isEnabledIncludingParents` ignores the enabled state of the parents and always returns the state of the button only.

So if a Form or GroupBox is disabled using `setEnabled(false)` or `setEnabledGranted(false)` or any other dimension, the full form gets disabled except the Close- and Cancel-Buttons. As soon as the button is disabled explicitly (e.g. by calling `setEnabled(false)` on the button itself or by propagating to the button using `setEnabled(false, false, true)` on a parent composite) it will be disabled and the form cannot be closed anymore.

== New Servlet Filters to create a Scout run context

Before Scout 9 the `ServerRunContextFilter` was used to create Scout server contexts for REST APIs. This filter used a user based TTL cache that was not bound to the HTTP session.

Starting with Scout 9 there are two new filters available:

* `HttpRunContextFilter`: Creates a Scout run-context without HTTP- and server sessions for stateless REST backends. It supports subject, correlationId, locale, transaction, etc.
* `HttpServerRunContextFilter`: Creates a Scout server-run-context that additionally has a user-agent and an optional Scout server session.

== Improved Scrollbar Usability

The layout structure of the scrollbar comes now with an additional div, and the positioning of the scollbar uses now padding instead of margin.

With this change, the usability of the scout scrollbar has improved. The thumb is now easier to catch, especially when positioned at the very edge of the screen.

== Design change for WizardProgressField

The wizard progress has a new design.

[[img-wizard-progress]]
.Wizard Progress
image::{imgsdir}/wizard_progress.png[]

Wizard steps can now be marked as finished, in this case they will be displayed with a check mark icon in the wizard progress.

== New widget Mode Selector

The widget "ModeSelector" was added. It has similar functionality as the RadioButtonGroup but with another design.

== Improvements for Pages in Scout JS applications

The API to work with Pages (`PageWithTable`, `PageWithNodes`) has been improved. It is now possible to declare child pages in the static JSON model of outlines and the table within a `PageWithTable` has a default reload handler installed.

Now the method `_loadTableData` (which is responsible for fetching data for a `PageWithTable`) also gets an optional argument `searchFilter` holding the exported data of the first form that is attached to the table using a `FormTableControl` (typically the SearchForm).
This makes it easier to use the values from a search form by e.g. passing them to a REST backend to limit the results returned from the server.

Finally the `TreeNode` (and therefore all pages because they are tree nodes) get a method `_jsonModel` to declare the static JSON model that belongs to that tree node or page. This works the same way as with all other widgets now.

== New event 'lookupCallDone'

All fields having lookup calls (ListBox, RadioButtonGroup, SmartField, TagField) now fire a new event 'lookupCallDone' always when a lookup call has been executed and the result was processed by the field.
