After the initial project creation step we can try to start the Scout application for the first time.
Since the Hello World app consists of a backend and a frontend, we need to start two servers, one for the backend and one for the frontend.
We also need to launch the JavaScript build that creates the JS and CSS bundles which will be served by the frontend server.
We could start each launch configuration separately, but for the sake of convenience there is a launch group available which starts all at once.

To start the launch group we use the [menu]_Run As_ menu as shown in <<img-start_all>>.

Because the JavaScript build needs a Node.js installation, the launching will fail if Node.js is not installed, see <<img-start_missing_node>>

If that is the case, we need to install a recent Node.js version.
To do this, we visit the official download page https://nodejs.org/en/, download the LTS version for our platform and install it.

IMPORTANT: The installation process could also fail if the installed Node.js is too old.
Scout requires at least Node.js 12.1.0.

After Node.js has been installed, we can try to launch the application again using the [menu]_Run as_ menu we used before.
This time you should see console output providing information about the JS build process.
Once the JS build has been completed successfully, the frontend and backend servers will be started automatically.
The servers are ready as soon as the console shows _Server ready_.
We can now access the Hello World application by navigating to http://localhost:8082/[http://localhost:8082,window=_blank] in our favorite web browser.

The running Hello World application should then be started in your browser as shown in <<img-start_browser>>.
