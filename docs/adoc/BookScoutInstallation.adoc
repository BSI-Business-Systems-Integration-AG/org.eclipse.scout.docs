[[apx-install_scout]]
== Scout Installation

=== Overview

This chapter walks you through the installation of Eclipse Scout.
The installation description (as well as the rest of this book) is written and tested for Eclipse Scout {doc-short-version} which is delivered as integral part of the Eclipse Oxygen release train, 2017.
Detailed information regarding the scheduling of this release train is provided in the Eclipse
wiki.footnote:[Release plan: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Oxygen/Simultaneous_Release_Plan].

We assume that you have not installed any software relevant for the content of this book.
This is why the Scout installation chapter starts with the installation of the Java Development Kit (JDK).
Consequently, you will have to skip some of the sections depending on your existing setup.

In the text below, installation routines are described separately for Windows, Mac, and Linux.


=== Download and Install a JDK

The first step to install Scout is to have an existing and working installation of a JDK version 11.
Please note that the Scout 9.0 Runtime does not officially support other Java versions. When downloading a Java 11 JDK it is recommended to choose version 11.0.1 or newer. Please note that only x64 hardware architectures are supported.

You can download the JDK archive matching your operating system from the Java homepage.footnote:[
OpenJDK 11 download: https://jdk.java.net/11/
] Afterwards extract the archive to a location of your choice.

To verify the installation you might want to go through this Java "`Hello World!`"
tutorial.footnote:[Windows Java "`Hello World!`": http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/win32.html].

[[sec-download_install]]
=== Download and Install Scout

include::DownloadAndInstallScout.adoc[]

If you have only installed a single JDK you will not need to change the default `eclipse.ini` file of your Eclipse installation.
In case you have installed multiple JDKs coming with their individual Java Runtime Environments (JREs), you might want to explicitly specify which JRE to use.
Open the file `eclipse.ini` in a editor of your choice and insert the following two lines at the top of the file:

----
-vm
C:\jdk-11.0.1\bin\server\jvm.dll
----

where the second line specifies the exact path to the JRE to be used to start your Eclipse Scout installation.

If you have explicitly specified the JRE to be used you verify this in the running Eclipse installation.
First, select the menu:Help[About Eclipse] menu to open the about dialog.
Then, click on the btn:[Installation Details] button and switch to the [tab]_Configuration_ tab.
In the long list of system properties you will find lines similar to the ones shown below.

----
*** Date: Donnerstag, 19. Juni 2014 10:37:17 Normalzeit

*** Platform Details:

*** System properties:
...
-vm
C:\jdk-11.0.1\bin\server\jvm.dll
...
sun.java.command=... vm C:\java\jdk1.8.0_77_x64\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll -vmargs ...
----

You have now successfully completed the Eclipse Scout installation on your Windows environment.
With this running Scout installation you may skip the following section on how to add Scout to an existing Eclipse installation.


=== Add Scout to your Eclipse Installation

This section describes the installation of Scout into an existing Eclipse installation.
As the audience of this section is assumed to be familiar with Eclipse, we do not describe how you got your Eclipse installation in the first place.
For the provided screenshots we start from the popular package _Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers_.

[[img-eclipse_install_new_software]]
.Eclipse menu to install additional software
image::{imgsdir}/eclipse_install_new_software.png[]

To add Scout to your existing Eclipse installation, you need to start Eclipse.
Then select the menu:Help[Install New Software...] menu as shown in <<img-eclipse_install_new_software>> to open the install dialog.

[[img-eclipse_add_repository]]
.Add the current Scout repository
image::{imgsdir}/eclipse_add_repository.png[]

In the install dialog, click on the btn:[Add...] button to enter the link to the Scout repository.
This opens the popup dialog _Add Repository_
As shown in <<img-eclipse_add_repository>>, you may use "`Scout Oxygen`" for the [field]_Name_ field.
For the [field]_Location_ field enter the Scout release repository as specified below.
http://download.eclipse.org/scout/releases/{doc-short-version}.

[[img-eclipse_select_scout_features]]
.Select the Scout features to add to the Eclipse installation
image::{imgsdir}/eclipse_select_scout_features.png[]

After the Eclipse IDE has connected to the Scout repository, select the Scout feature _Scout Application Development_ as shown in <<img-eclipse_select_scout_features>>.
Then, move through the installation with the btn:[Next] button.
On the last installation step, accept the presented EPL terms by clicking on the appropriate radio button.
To complete the installation, click the btn:[Finish] button and accept the request for a restart of Eclipse.
After the restart of the Eclipse IDE, you may add the Scout perspective using the menu:Window[Open Perspective,Other ...] menu and selecting the Scout perspective from the presented list.
Clicking on the Scout perspective button should then result in a state very similar to <<img-scout_perspective>>.


=== Verifying the Installation

After you can start your Eclipse Scout package you need to verify that Scout is working as intended.
The simplest way to verify your Scout installation is to create a "`Hello World`" Scout project and run the corresponding Scout application as described in <<cha-helloworld>>.

[appendix]
[[apx-install_tomcat]]
== Apache Tomcat Installation

Apache Tomcat is an open source web server that is a widely used implementation of the Java Servlet Specification.
Specifically, Tomcat works very well to run Scout applications.
In case you are interested in getting some general context around Tomcat you could start with the Wikipedia article.footnote:[
Apache Tomcat Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat.
].
Then get introduced to its core component "`Tomcat Catalina`".footnote:[
Mulesoft's introduction to Tomcat Catalina: http://www.mulesoft.com/tomcat-catalina.
]
before you switch to the official Tomcat homepage.footnote:[
Apache Tomcat Homepage: http://tomcat.apache.org/
].

This section is not really a step by step download and installation guide.
Rather, it points you to the proper places for downloading and installing Tomcat.
We recommend to work with Tomcat version 9.0.
Start your download from the official download site.footnote:[
Tomcat 9 Downloads: http://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
].

[[img-tomcat_install]]
.A successful Tomcat 7 installation.
image::{imgsdir}/tomcat_install.png[]

Once you have downloaded and installed Tomcat 9 (see the sections below for plattform specific guidelines) you can start the corresponding service or deamon.
To verify that Tomcat is actually running open a web browser of your choice and type http://localhost:8080 into the address bar.
You should then see a confirmation of the successful installation according to <<img-tomcat_install>>.


=== Platform Specific Instructions

According to the Tomcat setup installation for Windows.footnote:[
Tomcat Windows setup: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/setup.html#Windows
]
download the package "`32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer`" from the http://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi[Tomcat 9 download site].
Then, start the installer and accept the proposed default settings.

For installing Tomcat on OS X systems download the "`tar.gz`" package from the http://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi[Tomcat 9 download site].
Then, follow the installation guide.footnote:[
Installing Tomcat on OS X: http://wolfpaulus.com/journal/mac/tomcat8
] provided by Wolf Paulus.

For Linux systems download the "`tar.gz`" package from the http://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi[Tomcat 9 download site].
Then, follow the description of the Unix setup.footnote:[
Tomcat Linux setup: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/setup.html#Unix_daemon
]
to run Tomcat as a deamon.
If you use Ubuntu, you may want to follow the tutorial.footnote:[
Apache Tomcat Tutorial: http://www.vogella.com/articles/ApacheTomcat/article.html
]
for downloading and installing Tomcat provided by Lars Vogel.


[[apx-tomcat_dirs_and_files]]
=== Directories and Files

Tomcat's installation directory follows the same organisation on all platforms.
Here, we will only introduce the most important aspects of the Tomcat installation for the purpose of this book.

[[img-tomcat_install_dir]]
.The organisation of a Tomcat installation including specific files of interest. As an example, the "`Hello World`" server application is contained in subdirectory `webapps`.
image::{imgsdir}/tomcat_install_dir.png[]

Note that some folders and many files of a Tomcat installation are not represented in <<img-tomcat_install_dir>>.
We just want to provide a basic understanding of the most important parts to operate the web server in the context of this book.
In the [filename]+bin+ folder, the executable programs are contained, including scripts to start and stop the Tomcat instance.

The [filename]+conf+ folder contains a set of XML and property configuration files.
The file [filename]+server.xml+ represents Tomcat's main configuration file.
It is used to configure general web server aspects such as the port number of its connectors for the client server communication.
For the default setup, port number 8080 is used for the communication between clients applications and the web server.
The file [filename]+tomcat-users.xml+ contains a database of users, passwords and associated roles.

Folder [filename]+logs+ contains various logfiles of Tomcat itself as well as host and web application log files.
TODO [7.0] jbr: need to provide more on what is where (especially application logs and exact setup to generate log entries from scout apps).

The folder needed for deploying web applications into a Tomcat instance is called [filename]+webapps+.
It can be used as the target for copying WAR files into the web server.
The installation of the WAR file then extracts its content into the corresponding directory structure as shown in <<img-tomcat_install_dir>> in the case of the file [filename]+helloworld_server.war+.

Finally, folder [filename]+work+ contains Tomcat's runtime "`cache`" for the deployed web applications.
It is organized according to the hierarchy of the engine (Catalina), the host (localhost), and the web application ([filename]+helloworld_server+).

[[apx-tomcat_manager_app]]
=== The Tomcat Manager Application

Tomcat comes with the pre installed "`Manager App`".
This application is useful to manage web applications and perform tasks such as deploying a web application from a WAR file, or starting and stopping installed web applications.
A comprehensive documentation for the "`Manager App`" can be found under the Tomcat homepage.footnote:[
The Tomcat Manager Application: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html.
].
Here we only show how to start this application from the hompage of a running Tomcat installation.

To access this application you can switch to the "`Manager App`" with a click on the corresponding button on the right hand side.
The button can be found on the right hand side of <<img-tomcat_install>>.
Before you are allowed to start this application, you need to provide username and password credentials of a user associated with Tomcats's [java]+manager-gui+ role.

[[lst-tomcat.users]]
[source,xml]
.Tomcat Users configuration file.
----
  <tomcat-users>
    <!--
    NOTE: By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
    to operate the "/manager/html" web application. If you wish to use it
    you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.
    -->
    <user name="admin" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>
  </tomcat-users>
----

To get at user names and passwords you can open file [filename]+tomcat-users.xml+ located in Tomcat's [filename]+conf+ directory.
In this file the active users with their passwords and associated roles are stored.
See Listing <<lst-tomcat.users>> for an example.
From the content of this file, we see that user [java]+admin+ has password [java]+s3cret+ and also posesses the necessary role [java]+manager-gui+ to access the "`Manager App`".
If file [filename]+tomcat-users.xml+ does not contain any user with this role, you can simply add new user with this role to the existing users.
Alternatively, you also can add the necessary role to an existing user.
Just append a comma to the existing right(s) followed by the string [java]+manager-gui+.
Note that you will need to restart your Tomcat application after adapting the content of file [filename]+tomcat-users.xml+.

With working credentials you can now start the "`Manager App`" as described the "`Hello World`" tutorial in <<sec-helloworld_deploy>>.
