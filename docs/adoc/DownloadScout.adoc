=== Java and Maven

Before you download Scout make sure that you have a working Java Development Kit (JDK) and a working Maven installation.
In case you first need to download and install a JDK we recommend to work with the https://jdk.java.net/11/[Open JDK].
For Maven, head over to the https://maven.apache.org/[Maven project page].

To verify your Java installation use your command line.

----
C:\Users\mzi>java -version
openjdk version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13, mixed mode)
----

We recommend to use a JDK version 8.
Take note of the fact if your JDK is a 64-bit or a 32-bit installation.
In case your version text does not explicitly mention a 64-bit version your JDK is 32-bit installation.

Now check your Maven installation on the command line as well.

----
C:\Users\mzi>mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.6.0 (97c98ec64a1fdfee7767ce5ffb20918da4f719f3; 2018-10-24T20:41:47+02:00)
